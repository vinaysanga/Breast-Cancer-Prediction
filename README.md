# Breast Cancer Prediction
In this project, I try to predict the possibility of Breast Cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset from Kaggle.

## Implementations:
1. Firstly, I did some data preprocessing to understand the data.
2. Then, I implemented the following classfication algorithms:
   * Logistic Regression
   * KNN
   * Naive Bayes
   * Random Forest
   * Support Vector Classifier
## Results:
I got an accuracy above 93% in all the models tested. However, it needs to be mentioned that there was no K-Fold Cross Validation or Data Scaling. This was a very rudimentary experiment with an aim to understand the base performance of the above Machine Learning models without any kind of preprocessing applied.

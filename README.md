In this project, I try to predict the possibility of Breast Cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset from Kaggle
## Implementations:
1. Data Preprocessing(not feature selection)
2. Classfication Algorithms - 1. Logistic Regression, 2. KNN, 3. Naive Bayes, 4.Random Forest, 5. Support Vector Classifier
